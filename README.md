ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tony1959

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things raspberry pi. I have a bunch of them runniing and like them to do whatever I want. 
   I have dismissed the idea to rule the world. Setting my goals a bit lower: rule a herd of pi's!! Or any other linuxboxes.
   I have a ZOTAC box (mini PC), and a QNAP NAS.
      
ðŸ“« How to reach me ... Leave message here or send me an email.
